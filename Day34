Topics:JDBC Introduction

What is JDBC?
JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity. JDBC is a Java API to connect and execute the query with the database. It 
is a part of JavaSE (Java Standard Edition).
We can use JDBC API to access tabular data stored in any relational database. By the help of JDBC API, we can save, 
update, delete and fetch data from the database. It is like Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) provided by Microsoft. 

JDBC API uses JDBC drivers to connect with the database. There are four 
types of JDBC drivers: 
1. JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver, 
2. Native Driver, 
3. Network Protocol Driver, and 
4. Thin Driver
