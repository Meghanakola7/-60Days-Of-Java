Topics:Classes & Objects

What is a class?
A class in Java is a set of objects that share common characteristics and common properties. It is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
Components of java:
1.Class name
2.Access modifiers
3.Superclass
4.Interface
5.Body

Declaration of a class:
access_modifier class <class_name> 
{      
data member;       
method;       
constructor;     
nested class;     
interface;
}


What is an object?
An object is a real-world entity and is an instance of a class.An object is used to invoke a method in a class.

Methods to create an object:
1.new keyword
// Java Class example
class Student {
    // data member (also instance variable)
    int id;
    // data member (also instance variable)
    String n;
    public static void main(String args[]) {
      
        // creating an object of
        // Student
        Student s1 = new Student();
        System.out.println(s1.id);
        System.out.println(s1.n);
    }
}

2.using Reflection
Class<?> c = Class.forName("Student");
// Creating an object of the main class using reflection
Student o = (Student) c.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance();

3.using clone()
// creating object of class Test 
Test t1 = new Test();
 // creating clone of above object
 Test t2 = (Test)t1.clone();
