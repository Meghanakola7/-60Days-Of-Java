Topics:Encapsulation

What is encapsulation?
Encapsulation in Java is a fundamental object-oriented programming concept that involves bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. 
It also restricts direct access to some of the object's components, enhancing security and data integrity.
We can achieve encapsulation by:
- declare class variables/attributes as private
- provide public get and set methods to access and update the value of a private variable
 

Examples:
public class Person {
  private String name; // private = restricted access

  // Getter
  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }

  // Setter
  public void setName(String newName) {
    this.name = newName;
  }
}
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Person person = new Person();
    person.setName("Arjun Nair"); 
    System.out.println(person.getName());
  }
}
