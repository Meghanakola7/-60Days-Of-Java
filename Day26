Topics:Wrapper Classes

What is a Wrapper Class?
Wrapper classes are object representations of primitive data types.All the wrapper classes (Integer, Long, Byte, Double, Float, Short) are subclasses of the abstract class Number.

Boxing and Unboxing:
Converting of a primitive data type to wrapper object is called Boxing.
Converting of a wrapper object into primitive data type is called Unboxing.

Classes:
1.Boolean
2.Character
3.Double
4.Float
5.Integer
6.Short
7.Long
8.Byte

Methods:
1.toString()
2.compareTo()
3.Parsexxx()-xxx represents any datatype
4.xxxValue()
5.equals(Object obj)
6.MAX_VALUE and MIN_VALUE
7.isDigit(), isLetter(), isUpperCase()


Why Do We Need Wrapper Classes?
1.To make convertions between two data types
2.When we need to work with Collections
3.To handle null values
4.While working with OOP's features
