Architecture:
Step1:Create a java sourcecodewith .java extension
Step2:Compile the source code using java compiler, which will create bytecode file with .class extension
Step3:Class loader readsboth the user defined and libraryclasses into the memoryfor execution.
Step4:Bytecode verifier validates all the bytecodes are valid and do not violate Java’s security restrictions
Step5:JVMreads bytecodes and translates into machine code for execution. While execution of the program the code will interact to the operating system and hardware

What is JVM?
It is an interpreter which converts the byte code to machine specific instructions and executes.JVM is the one that calls the main method present in a Java code.TheJVM will differ from platform to platform,and is,platform-specific.

What is JDK?
The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used to develop Java applications and applets. It contains JRE and several development tools, an interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (javadoc) accompanied with another tool.
JDK=JRE + Development tools

What is JRE?
The JRE software builds a runtime environment in which Java programs can be executed. The JRE is the on-disk system that takes your Java code, combines it with the needed libraries, and starts the JVM to execute it.
The JRE contains libraries and software needed by your Java programs to run. JRE is a part of JDK (which we will study later) but can be downloaded separately.
JRE=JVM + Library Classes

Process:
sample.java → javac (sample. class) → JVM(sample.obj) → final output
