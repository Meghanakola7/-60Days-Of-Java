Bubble sort Alogithm:
The Bubble Sort algorithm is a simple sorting technique that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 

Ex:
import java.util.Scanner;
class BubbleSort {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int arr[] = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
                if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                    // Swap
                    int temp = arr[j];
                    arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                    arr[j + 1] = temp;
                }
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
        }
    }
}

Time complexity:O(n^2)
Space complexity:O(1)

Insertion Sort:Insertion Sort is a comparison based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time.
It works by taking one element from the input array and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted part of the array.
Algorithm:
for i = 1 to n-1:
key = array[i]
j = i - 1
while j >= 0 and array[j] > key:
array[j + 1] = array[j]
j = j - 1
array[j + 1] = key
