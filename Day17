Topics:Inheritance

What is Inheritance?
Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP's in which a child class can inherit the properties(methods or fields) from it's parent that contains all the properties to be inherited.
We can achieve inheritance by using "extends" keyword.

Example:
class Vehicles{
void Car(){
System.out.println("Car is one of the vehicles");
}
}
class Bike extends Vehicles{
Bike(){
System.out.println("Bike is a vehicle");
}
}
public class Main{
public static void main(String args[]){
Bike bike=new Bike();
bike.Car();
}
}
