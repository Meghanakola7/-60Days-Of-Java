Topics:imports and packages

Packages:Packages in Java are a mechanism that encapsulates a group of classes, sub-packages, and interfaces.
1.Prevent naming conflicts by allowing classes with the same name to exist in different packages, like college.staff.cse.Employee and college.staff.ee.Employee.
2.They make it easier to organize, locate, and use classes, interfaces, and other components.
3.Packages also provide controlled access for Protected members that are accessible within the same package and by subclasses.
4.Also, default members (no access specifier) are accessible only within the same package.

imports
Import statement in Java is helpful to take a class or all classes visible for a program specified under a package, with the help of a single statement. 
It is pretty beneficial as the programmer do not require to write the entire class definition. Hence, it improves the readability of the program. 
Ex:import java.util.*;

Program:
import java.util.Scanner;
package mypack;
public class EvenOddCheck {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        int number = scanner.nextInt();
        if (number % 2 == 0) {
            System.out.println(number + " is Even.");
        } else {
            System.out.println(number + " is Odd.");
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
